# Package Management Tools

This repo contains tools for working with RPM packages, especially on Windows. Specifically, it implements the `rpminfo` and `rpm2gz` commands that are available on Linux using .Net. Technically, these can run on any OS that .Net runs on, including Linux. However, since the tools already exist natively on Linux, their usefulness is more on Windows, which doesn't have these tools.
